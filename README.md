# Signup and Login System

A user authentication system that includes features for signing up, logging in, and session management. This project provides a simple and secure implementation of these functionalities using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

## Features

- User signup with email and password
- Secure password hashing using bcrypt
- User login with JWT-based authentication
- Middleware to protect routes requiring authentication
- Token generation and validation
- Environment configuration using `.env` file

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before starting:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12+)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (local or cloud-based)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/signup-and-login.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd signup-and-login
Install dependencies:

npm install
Set up your environment variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory and configure the following variables:

MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
Start the development server:

npm start
The app will be running at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
API Endpoints
POST /signup â€“ Allows a new user to sign up.
POST /login â€“ Authenticates a user and returns a JWT.
